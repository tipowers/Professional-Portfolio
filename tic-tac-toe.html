            <p>I learned and utilized quite a bit of Python in college and built close to 40 small programs. One of the earlier programs was a game of Tic-Tac-Toe.
                I went through 3 iterations of this game and some help from my professor before getting it right. We had just learned arrays and 
                I was struggling with putting the necessary arrays for Tic-Tac-Toe into practice. After some advice from my professor I was able to make it work!</p>
            <p>Essentially, I created a 3x3 matrix and set a variable to it which was used to display the game board.
                I then created the functions necessary for a game of Tic-Tac-Toe. I created a function that would get a player input of which position on the board they want to choose.
                A function that would check player input to ensure the position had not already been taken. A function that would display and refresh 
                the matrix with an X or O depending on the current player's selected position. A function that would change players after each turn and a results function. 
                Lastly, I created a main function that calls each function in the order required for the game.

        <div class="portfolio-item-individual--p2">
            <p>To win the game of Tic-Tac-Toe player one is assigned as O and the player two is assigned as X. Both players must attempt to get three X's or three O's in a row.
                On a players turn they must strategically pick which position on the board to place their X or O. The first player to get three X's or O's in a row wins!
            </p>
            <p>To play you will need a working version of Python. I have included the download link of the latest version <a class="download__link" href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here...</a></p>
            <p>Once Python is installed, simply copy and paste the <a class="project__link--2" href="https://github.com/tipowers/Tic-Tac-Toe/blob/master/Tic-Tac-Toe.py">Github code</a> into the Python editor and run the program.</p>
