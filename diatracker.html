            <p>During my Software System Analysis course our class was broken down into groups of 4. 
                Each group was to come up with and develop a working application from the ground up.
                Our group decided on a Diabetes Tracker application that would assist diabetics and those who assist diabetics 
                with monitoring their diets, insulin intakes, and providing helpful information when needed. 
            </p>
            <p>Each team member was assigned a designation within the group. I was the project leader, 
                two members were designer/developers, and the last member focused on testing and debugging.
                Each week included project build updates as well as learning and applying the Software Development
                Lifecycle fundamentals through assignments. The team worked cohesively to complete each weekly assignment.

            <p>Due to the team cohesion and willingness of each member to take on what was needed of them the development lifecycle was
                much easier for all members. At the end of the project, when the team was debriefing, we collectively agreed that no one
                team member felt overburdened and that it was a joy working with a team that communicated so well. We each contributed to the
                project in such a way that each members strength is on full display in the final product. I hope to soon work with a team such
                as this one!
